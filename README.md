# Unit 2 Assessment - JavaScript Fundamentals
## Written Assessment

1. The function declaration comes _after_ the variable declaration in the code below. Why does it still work?
```javascript
let greeting = "Hello"!

function sayItLoud() {
  console.log(`${greeting}!!!`)
}

sayItLoud();
```

2. Okay... so why does the code below throw an error?
```javascript
sayItLoud();

function sayItLoud() {
  console.log(`${greeting}!!!}`)
}

let greeting = "Hello"
```

3. Mmhmmm... so what about this😰. What does the following code log? Why?
```javascript
sayItLoud();
function sayItLoud() {
  console.log(`${greeting}!!!`)
}
var greeting = "Hello"
```

4. Why does the following block of code throw an error? Fix this without changing the variable declaration keyword.
```javascript
const isMaya🧘🏽‍♀️ = true;

if (isMaya🧘🏽‍♀️) {
  let status = 'Everything is just fine';
} else {
  let status = 'Time to panic.'
}

console.log(status);
```

5. Why does the following block of code NOT throw an error?
```javascript
const isLaishaOnTime = true;

if (isLaishaOnTime) {
  var status = 'Everything is just fine';
} else {
  var status = 'Time to panic.'
}

console.log(status);
```

6. In JavaScript, we can declare variables with `var`, `let`, and `const`. What are the differences between each? Be sure to comment on how each declaration impacts the _scope_, _reassignment_, and _hoisting_ of variables.


7. Where does the following code throw an error? What type of error? Why?
```javascript
let a = b;

console.log(a);
```
**tags:** #variableDeclaration
**key:** "the variable `b` is not defined."

8. What is the value of `b` after this code runs? Explain why this is the case.
```javascript
let a = 1;
let b = a;
a += 1;

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
```
**tags:** #mutability
**key:** "`b` points to the integer `1`, a primitive data type", "reassigning `a` has no effect on `b`" 



9. What does the following code log? Explain why?
```javascript
let a = {goals: "Enmanuel"};
let b = a;
a.goals = "Cielo";
console.log(b.goals);
```
**tags:** #mutability
**key:** "`b` points to the same object referenced by `a`"

10. Where does the following code throw an error? What type of error? Why?
```javascript
const bffs = 'Enmanuel Laisha';
bffs = 'Enmanuel Laisha Cielo';

console.log(bffs);
```
**tags**: #variableDeclaration #mutability #primitives
**key:** "variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned"

11. Wait, why doesn't the code below throw an error?! 🧐 What does this demonstrate?
```javascript
const bffs = ['Enmanuel', 'Laisha'];
bffs.push('Cielo');

console.log(bffs);
```
**tags:** #mutability #objects
**key:** "`bffs` was not reassigned", "JavaScript objects are mutable"


12. What does the following code log? Why?
```javascript
let greeting = "What's up?";

function say() {
 return `${greeting}! 🤟🏿`
}

console.log(say);
```
**tags**: #functionExecution #functionArguments
**key:** "function was not invoked"

13. What does the following code log? What does this say about JavaScript function arguments?
```javascript
function shoutOut() {
  console.log(`The flyest person in the room is Carmen!`);
}

shoutOut('Devonte');
```
**tags:** #functionExecution #variableScope
**key:** "arguments are optional", "extraneous arguments are ignored"

14. What happens if a function is invoked with fewer arguments than there are parameters? Include a code snippet to illustrate.
**tags:** #functionExecution #functionArguments
**key:** "missing parameters are set to `undefined`"

15. What about extra parameters? How can we access them and use them to our advantage? Illustrate by writing a function that takes any number of integers as arguments and returns their sum.

Example:
```javascript
sum(1, 2, 10); // 13
sum(5); // 5
sum(100, 200, 800, 1, 1, 1); // 1103;
```

16. What does the following code log? Why?
```javascript
let theCreator = 'Devonte';

function shoutOut() {
  theCreator = 'Peter';
}

shoutOut();
console.log(`The best designer in the room is ${theCreator}`.);
```
**tags:** #variableScope
**key:** "functions have access to variables defined in their local scope and all surrounding scopes"

17. What does the following code log? Why?
```javascript
let theHustler = 'Laisha';

function shoutOut() {
  let theHustler = `Paul`;
  console.log(`${theHustler} is the hardest working person in the room.`);
}

shoutOut();
console.log(`${theHustler} is also the hardest working person in the room.`);
```
**tags:** #variableScope
**key:** "lexical scope"

18. What does the following code log? Why?
```javascript
let theCEO;

function hire(theCEO) {
  theCEO = 'Mark';
}

hire(theCEO);
console.log(`I have no doubt that ${theCEO} will be running a company of his own very soon. I just hope that he will hire me when I need a job.`);
```
**tags:** #variableScope
**key:** "variable shadowing" the function declarations creates a _new_ local variable declaration for its parameter, `theCEO`."

19. What does it mean to _pass by value_? For what data types does JavaScript _pass by value_? Use a code snippet to illustrate.
**tags:** #mutability #functionExecution
**key:** "primitive data types are passed by value"

20. What does it mean to _pass by reference_? For what data types does JavaScript _pass by reference_? Use a code snippet to illustrate.
**tags:** #mutability #functionExecution
**key:** "JavaScript objects are passed by reference"

21. Explain why the first code snippet below throws an error, but the second does not.

```javascript
10 + a;        // ReferenceError: a is not defined
```

```javascript
let a = {};
10 + a.x;      // Evaluates to NaN
```
**tags:** #objects
**key:** "udefined properties of objects return `undefined`"

22. What is the relationship between JavaScript Objects and JavaScript Arrays? We say a JavaScript Object is _empty_ if it has no properties of its own. We say that a JavaScript Array is _empty_ if it has no _elements_. How do we check for emptiness of JavaScript Objects? How do we check for emptiness of JavaScript Arrays. Use code snippets to illustrate your answer.
**tags:** #objects #arrays
**key:** "JavaScript arrays are objects", "use `.length` to check for array emptiness", "use Object.keys(object) to check for object emptiness"

## Problem Set
1. Write a function that takes a string, doubles every consonant character in the string, and returns the result as a new string. The function should not double vowels (``'a'``,``'e'``,``'i'``,``'o'``,``'u'``), digits, punctuation, or whitespace.

Examples:
```javascript
doubleConsonants('String');          // "SSttrrinngg"
doubleConsonants('Hello-World!');    // "HHellllo-WWorrlldd!"
doubleConsonants('July 4th');        // "JJullyy 4tthh"
doubleConsonants('');                // ""
```

2. Write a function that takes a string and returns the string reversed.

Examples:
```javascript
reverse('Test'); // "tseT"
reverse('anotherTest'); // "tseTrehtona"
reverse('factor In spaces'); // "secaps nI rotcaf"
reverse(''); // ""
```

3. Write a function takes an integer `year` as an argument and returns a boolean based on whether the year is a leap year. Note: Every year that is evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year, except every year that is evenly divisible by 100, unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400.

Examples:
```javascript
isLeapYear(1997); // false
isLeapYear(1996); // true
isLeapYear(1900); // false
isLeapYear(2000); // true
```

4. Write a function that takes a sentence string as an argument, and returns that string with every occurrence of a "number word" — `'zero'`, `'one'`, `'two'`, `'three'`, `'four'`, `'five'`, `'six'`, `'seven'`, `'eight'`, `'nine'` — converted to its corresponding digit character.

Example:
```javascript
wordToDigit('Please call me at five five five one two three four. Thanks.');
// "Please call me at 5 5 5 1 2 3 4. Thanks."
```

5. For a game of Dungeons & Dragons, each player starts by generating a character they can play with. This character has, among other things, six abilities; strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and charisma. These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly. You do this by rolling four 6-sided dice and record the sum of the largest three dice. You do this six times, once for each ability.

Your character's initial hitpoints are 10 + your character's constitution modifier. You find your character's constitution modifier by subtracting 10 from your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.

Write a random character generator function that follows the rules above.

For example, the six throws of four dice may look like:
  * 5, 3, 1, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, which you assign to strength.
  * 3, 2, 5, 3: You discard the 2 and sum 3 + 5 + 3 = 11, which you assign to dexterity.
  * 1, 1, 1, 1: You discard the 1 and sum 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which you assign to constitution.
  * 2, 1, 6, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 2 + 6 + 6 = 14, which you assign to intelligence.
  * 3, 5, 3, 4: You discard the 3 and sum 5 + 3 + 4 = 12, which you assign to wisdom.
  * 6, 6, 6, 6: You discard the 6 and sum 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, which you assign to charisma.
Because constitution is 3, the constitution modifier is -4 and the hitpoints are 6.

Your function should take one argument, a `name`. It should generate random attribute values using `Math.rand()`. The function should return a JavaScript Object that contains all of the above attributes.

Example:
```javascript
characterGenerator("Elminster");

/*
{
  name: "Elminster"
  strength: 10,
  dexterity: 8,
  constitution: 12,
  intelligence: 14,
  wisdom: 12,
  charisma: 18,
  hitpoints: 11
}

*/
```
